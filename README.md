# Finding the Last Index of a Character

In this coding challenge, your goal is to build a Java program that serves as a tool for locating the index of the last occurrence of a specific character in a given string. Picture yourself developing a utility where users input a string and a target character, and the program returns the last index at which the character appears in the string. If the character is not found, the program should return -1.
Input: A single line of input containing a string (str) followed by a character (character) on the next line.
Output: Print the last index at which the character appears in the string. If the character is not found, print -1.

Examples:
Input: Hello, this is java
       i
Output: 12

Input: Welcome to GitHb
       z
Output: -1
